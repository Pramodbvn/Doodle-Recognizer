
**Neural-networks**

While we can use ‘basis function expansion’ or ‘kernel methods’ for building a non-

linear modelling, in real life scenarios it is very difficult to choose what functions to

use for either of these methods. On the other hand, Neural networks captures the

non-linear relationship between Input data and the output labels naturally, and thus

they are very powerful.
